Start_AA,End_AA
T415K, CTL responce
N334X, loosing N glycan near V3 loop
T162I, this mutation knok out the glycan at position N160 and common and confirmed resistance [Christine A Bricault]
T278S, this mutaion presumably related to (or induce) N276 which increases resistance to CD4bs bnAbs [Constantinos Kurt Wibmer 2013 PLoS Pathogens]
